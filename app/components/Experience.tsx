                Experience in an experimental startup, where I was the team lead of up to 8 other collaborators working daily. Oversaw each individuals role and progression towards creating a trustworthy, up-to-date medical resource for any audience. Our team successfully completed NSF I-corps innovation regional and national program, received funding from Amazon.
                Manually configuring and troubleshooting 6 physical hardware mounted rack servers. Integrated Amazon web Services S3 buckets and custom EC2 instances. Attributed to the front-end(Bootstrap, JQuery D3JS, Observablehq, Apache echarts, phpMongo Driver), back-end(mongod) and machine learning(tensorflow, spark) requirements of our system. 
                Determined user requirements alongside Dr. Gubanov, to design and implement new code or modify existing code. Held weekly team meetings to discuss our results.
